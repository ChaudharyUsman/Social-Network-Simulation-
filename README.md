# Social Network Simulation

## Overview

This C++ project simulates a social network using advanced data structures. Individuals are represented as nodes, relationships as edges, and dynamic algorithms simulate network changes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the C++ project on Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChaudharyUsman/Social-Network-Simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the Visual Studio solution file (`SocialNetworkSimulation.sln`).

### Running the Project

1. Build the solution:

    - Press `F7` or go to `Build` in the top menu and select `Build Solution`.

2. Run the simulation:

    - Press `F5` to start debugging.

This will launch the C++ project, and you can interact with it through the console or any user interface defined in the project.
